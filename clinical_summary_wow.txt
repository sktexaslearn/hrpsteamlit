**Clinical Alerts and Diagnoses (Enhanced by STORM)**
- ALERT: Risk of post-surgical complications (Score: 40%). 
    Post-surgical management of craniosynostosis requires:
    - Imaging (CT/MRI) every 6-12 months to monitor cranial shape and intracranial pressure.
    - Lab tests (CBC, CRP) to detect infections, especially within 6 months post-surgery.
    - Developmental screening at ages 2, 4, and 6 to assess cognitive/motor delays.
    - Complications include infection (5-10% risk), wound dehiscence, and hydrocephalus.
    - ICD-10: Q75.0 (Craniosynostosis).

- ALERT: Imaging outdated (Score: 70%, last CT on 05/02/2021). Schedule new CT/MRI. 
    Post-surgical management of craniosynostosis requires:
    - Imaging (CT/MRI) every 6-12 months to monitor cranial shape and intracranial pressure.

    - ICD-10: Q75.0 (Craniosynostosis).

- ALERT: No recent lab results (Score: 40%). Order CBC and CRP.

- DIAGNOSIS: Likely craniosynostosis (ICD-10: Q75.0).

- NOTE: No Known Drug Allergies (NKDA). Safe to prescribe standard post-surgical antibiotics.
- INSIGHT: 5-10% likelihood of infection based on missing labs and surgical history.

**Care Plan (Prioritized)**
- Priority 1: Schedule new CT/MRI to monitor cranial surgery outcomes (Score: 70%)
- Priority 2: Refer for developmental screening (Score: 50%)
- Priority 3: Order CBC and CRP to rule out infection (Score: 40%)

**Recommendations**
Follow care plan above and schedule follow-up: SFC_PK_CRANIOFACIAL4 for Established Patient 30 at SFC_PEDI PLAST SRG_STRCT 301.
